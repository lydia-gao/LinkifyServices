## Password Reset & Management (Planned)

### Table: password_reset_tokens (planned)

| Column     | Type      | Constraints                                     | Description                                   |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| id         | SERIAL    | PRIMARY KEY                                     | Unique identifier for each reset token record |
| user_id    | INTEGER   | NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE | User requesting the reset                     |
| token      | TEXT      | NOT NULL UNIQUE                                 | Secure random token                           |
| expires_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL                                        | Expiration timestamp for this token           |
| used       | BOOLEAN   | NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE                          | Whether the token has been used               |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP              | When the token record was created             |

**Indexes:**

- INDEX on `user_id`
- INDEX on `expires_at`

**SQL for creating the table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS password_reset_tokens (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  used BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_prt_user ON password_reset_tokens (user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_prt_expires ON password_reset_tokens (expires_at);
```

**Relationship: User-to-PasswordResetTokens**

- One-to-many: A single user may request multiple password reset tokens, each generating a new record
- Lifecycle: Each token record tracks creation time, expiry, and usage status
- Deletion: When a user is deleted, all their related password reset tokens are also removed (ON DELETE CASCADE)

### Password Management Flows (Planned)

#### 1. Forgot Password (Not Logged In)

1. User submits email, system generates a secure `token` and writes it to the `password_reset_tokens` table
2. System sends a reset link with the token to the user's email
3. User clicks the link, frontend collects new password and submits, backend verifies token validity (not expired, not used)
4. Update user password and mark the token as used

#### 2. Change Password (Logged In)

1. User enters old and new password in the profile center
2. Backend verifies the old password and updates to the new password

## Planned Endpoints for Password Reset & Management

The following API endpoints are planned to support the password reset and management features described above:

- Request password reset (initiate reset via email)
- Confirm password reset (submit new password with token)
- Change password (for logged-in users)

Additional advanced features for the future:

- User multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA)
- User security logs and abnormal login alerts
- User self-service account deletion and data export
- API rate limiting and security protection
- More comprehensive user profile fields and social features
